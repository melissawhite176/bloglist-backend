//CONTROLLERS/BLOGS.JS -> all of the routes related to blogs in this directory

/*A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes.
You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware and routing functions.
Every Express application has a built-in app router.
A router behaves like middleware itself, so you can use it as an argument to app.use()
or as the argument to another router’s use() method.
The top-level express object has a Router() method that creates a new router object.
Once you’ve created a router object, you can add middleware and HTTP method routes
(such as get, put, post, and so on) to it just like an application.*/
